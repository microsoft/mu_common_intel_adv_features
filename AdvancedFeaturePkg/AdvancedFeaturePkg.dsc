#  Advanced Feature Package build description file.
#
# Advanced features allow a board package to be extended with advanced functionality.
#
# This package should not contain any specific advanced features. The package has two responsibilities:
# 1. Present a consolidated and simplified view of all available advanced features to board packages.
# 2. Provide a simple, single package build for all available advanced features.
