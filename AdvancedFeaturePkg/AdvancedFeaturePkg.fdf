# FDF file generating AdvancedFeature FV for inclusion in a MinPlatform design.

# There are three FV produced, FvAdvancedPreMemory.fv, FvAdvancedUncompressed.fv, and
# FvAdvanced.fv.  The sizes are arbitrary as these are not expected to be used as is
# in today's usages.  Boards will tune FV by selecting or deseleting features and building.
