# Note: The EDK II DSC file is not used to specify how compiled binary images get placed
#       into firmware volume images. This section is just a list of modules to compile from
#       source into UEFI-compliant binaries.
#       It is the FDF file that contains information on combining binary files into firmware
#       volume images, whose concept is beyond UEFI and is described in PI specification.
#       There may also be modules listed in this section that are not required in the FDF file,
#       When a module listed here is excluded from FDF file, then UEFI-compliant binary will be
#       generated for it, but the binary will not be put into any firmware volume.
