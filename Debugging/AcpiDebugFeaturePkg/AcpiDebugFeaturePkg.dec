  ## This PCD specifies whether the feature is active.
  #
  #  The PCD value can be modified at boot time to activate and deactivate the feature functionality.
  #
  #  Note that this differs from Pcd<FeatureName>FeatureEnable which determines whether the feature is included
  #  as an advanced feature in the flash image. If enabled, the feature is then eligible to be activated/deactivated
  #  via this PCD.
  #
  #  An enabled but deactivated feature will be dispatched but exit in its entry point without performing any
  #  feature actions.

  ## This PCD specifies ACPI debug message buffer address.
  #  The PCD value will be updated during boot time when the buffer is allocated.
